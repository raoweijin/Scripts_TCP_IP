Based on my testing the TCP socket holds up to 10KB of data in this temp queue when device lost registration or remote server is sleeping.
 The queue size is 10KB with or without the fixe for SARA_R4-1983. This JIRA only fixes the AT interface lockup after this queue is filled up.

@Chiko,

The 32KB I mentioned is the size of TCP buffer (this buffer is never filled up ) and is different from this one. 
I think what the customers should know is the 10KB and not the 32KB. Sorry about the confusion here.

Let me know if you guys have more questions on this one.


There is only one queue i.e. the TCP receive window. And you are right that is 16384 bytes, so our module can hold 16384 bytes of data without reading.
TCP socket will send TCP zero window if we do not read the data and the server continues to send data.
